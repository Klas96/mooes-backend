# ✅ Convex Functions Deployed!

Your Convex functions have been successfully deployed to production:

**Production Deployment:** `https://loyal-capybara-991.convex.cloud`

## What Was Deployed

✅ Schema (all tables defined)  
✅ User queries and mutations  
✅ User Profile queries and mutations  
✅ Store queries and mutations  
✅ Store Goal queries and mutations  
✅ User Goal Progress queries and mutations  
✅ Coupon queries and mutations  
✅ Training Session queries and mutations  

## Final Step: Verify CONVEX_URL in Vercel

To make the backend use Convex, ensure `CONVEX_URL` is set in Vercel:

1. **Check current value:**
   ```bash
   vercel env ls
   ```

2. **If it's not set to production, update it:**
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/klas-projects-ee322207/mooves-backend/settings/environment-variables
   - Update `CONVEX_URL` to: `https://loyal-capybara-991.convex.cloud`
   - Or it should already be set (check the value)

3. **Redeploy Vercel:**
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

4. **Verify it's working:**
   - Check logs: `vercel logs --follow`
   - You should see: `✅ Convex service initialized: https://loyal-capybara-991.convex.cloud`
   - Try logging in - it should work now!

## Current Status

- ✅ Convex functions deployed to production
- ✅ Schema deployed
- ⚠️ Need to verify `CONVEX_URL` is set correctly in Vercel
- ⚠️ May need to redeploy Vercel after setting environment variable

Once `CONVEX_URL` is confirmed and Vercel is redeployed, your backend will be fully running on Convex! 🎉
